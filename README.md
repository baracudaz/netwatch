One binary, no config. `sudo netwatch` and you have live capture with L7 decode, process attribution where available, and a diagnostic engine that opens an issue when a learned baseline breaks and closes it when the fix holds.

## Install

```bash
brew install netwatch                 # macOS / Linux
nix-shell -p netwatch                 # NixOS / Nix
paru -S netwatch-tui-bin              # Arch
scoop install netwatch                # Windows (needs Npcap)
cargo install netwatch-tui            # anywhere with Rust and libpcap headers
```

Prebuilt binaries are on the [releases page](https://github.com/matthart1983/netwatch/releases/latest). The Linux x86_64/aarch64 binaries are static with libpcap bundled in, so they need nothing installed. There's also an armv5te build for older Marvell Kirkwood NAS boxes (e.g. Iomega ix2-dl) running Debian — libpcap is bundled the same way, but it links against glibc, which any real Debian install already has. Windows needs [Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download) installed first; building from source needs `libpcap-dev` (Debian), `libpcap-devel` (Fedora) or `libpcap` (Arch). Details in the [install reference](docs/REFERENCE.md#permissions).

## Run

```bash
netwatch              # interfaces, connections, config. No privileges.
sudo netwatch         # enables capture where elevated access is required
netwatch --lite       # one 80x24 screen
netwatch --view dense # four boxes, 130x44 or larger
```

`1` to `9` and `0` switch tabs, `V` cycles the three views, `?` shows every key. To run without sudo on Linux, grant the capabilities once: `sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' "$(which netwatch)"` ([why and when to repeat it](docs/REFERENCE.md#running-without-sudo-linux)).

## What it does

**Diagnose (tab `9`).** Per-metric baselines scoped to the network that taught them; readiness requires 1,800 distinct samples, so learning time depends on probe cadence. 25 catalogued rules, with 18 implemented Diagnose detectors and seven awaiting integration. Runtime coverage states which inputs are available, learning, stale, or unmeasured. A suppression graph groups a dead gateway and its consequences under one finding. Each cause is ranked by the checks that separated it from the others. Automatic TUI resolver changes remain unavailable; Diagnose provides manual steps. An explicit [Linux resolver command](docs/resolver-adapter.md) supports temporary changes to administrator-confirmed unmanaged regular files; managed resolvers remain unsupported. The demo still simulates apply and verified recovery. Existing journals are inspected on startup, and unreadable or corrupt recovery records block further host changes. An issue closes only when the rule's own success condition has held. No model involved. [How it works](docs/REFERENCE.md#how-it-works), [the design](docs/DESIGN-0.30.md#9-9-diagnose).

</p>

**Decrypt TLS you control.** Point any client's `SSLKEYLOGFILE` at NetWatch and the plaintext of its TLS 1.3 sessions decodes in the Packets tab. Same mechanism as Wireshark, so it only works for traffic you hold the keys to. [TLS decryption](docs/REFERENCE.md#tls-13--12-decryption).

```bash
sudo netwatch                                              # open Packets (4)
SSLKEYLOGFILE=/tmp/keys curl https://example.com           # any client that exports keys
# filter the tab with:  decrypted:true
```

**Egress drift.** The Egress tab (`0`) learns which hosts, autonomous systems and ports each process reaches. `Enter` promotes that baseline to a rule; the next new destination arrives as `drift` with an alert. It observes and never blocks. Verdicts are `sni`, `ip`, `asn`, `ech`, `drift`, `no rule` and `undeclared` under `strict = true`, because "matched by AS" admits everything a hyperscaler runs and the table should say so. [Rule language and export schema](docs/egress-linter-plan.md).

**Process attribution.** Platform socket polling, PKTAP on macOS, and an optional eBPF kprobe on Linux (`ebpf` feature). Attribution can be missing or stale, especially for short-lived flows; Windows uses its own network/process tools. [Permissions](docs/REFERENCE.md#permissions).

**Threat detection.** C2 beaconing, port scans and DNS tunnelling run in the background. A critical alert freezes the flight recorder so the bundle exists before you look. JA4 fingerprints each TLS and QUIC handshake so you can pivot to every flow from the same client. [Security and forensics](docs/REFERENCE.md#security--forensics), [flight recorder](docs/REFERENCE.md#flight-recorder), [JA4](docs/REFERENCE.md#threat-hunting-with-ja4).

**Linux worker sandbox.** Worker entry points apply a prepared Landlock filesystem policy before processing; capture prepares its device first. Writable grants use dedicated application directories. eBPF attribution is temporarily disabled in sandboxed runs pending an SDK reader hook. Network access remains unrestricted, and privileged capture/restart validation is pending. [Scope and limitations](docs/REFERENCE.md#landlock-sandbox-linux).

## The tabs

| # | Tab | Shows |
|---|-----|-------|
| 1 | Dashboard | Latency tiles, mirrored throughput, the link carrying it, connections rolled up per process |
| 2 | Connections | Every socket with process, PID, state, GeoIP, RTT, retransmits |
| 3 | Interfaces | Addresses, MTU, rates, errors, drops |
| 4 | Packets | Live decode, TLS 1.3 decryption, JA4, stream tracking, display filters, PCAP export |
| 5 | Stats | Protocol breakdown and handshake-timing histogram |
| 6 | Topology | Machine, gateway, DNS, top hosts, traceroute |
| 7 | Timeline | Connections by TCP state, with alerts |
| 8 | Processes | Bandwidth per process |
| 9 | Diagnose | Issue, cause, fix, verified close. `report.md` from the same objects |
| 0 | Egress | Learned destinations, promoted policy, drift |

[Every keybinding](docs/REFERENCE.md#keyboard-controls), [display filters](docs/REFERENCE.md#display-filters), [decoders](docs/REFERENCE.md#deep-packet-inspection), [themes](docs/REFERENCE.md#themes), [configuration](docs/REFERENCE.md#configuration).

## Three views, one capture

`V` cycles between them without a restart; the collectors keep running.

**Full** is the ten tabs above.

**Lite** (`--lite`) fits 80x24: throughput, gateway/DNS/internet reachability, top talkers, six keys. For an SSH session to a Pi or a tmux split.

**Dense** (`--view dense`) is the hero image. It needs 130x44 and grows into anything larger. Throughput is braille at two samples per cell, coloured by height so a spike reads before you check the axis. The connection table hoists the selected row's detail, including kernel `cwnd`, `ssthresh`, `mss` and `rwnd`, into the top of its own box. `1` to `4` zoom a box to the whole screen. [Dense and Lite](docs/DESIGN-0.30.md#8-dense-and-lite).

## Thanks

I packaged none of this. Dominiquini and kemelzaidan maintain [`netwatch-tui`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netwatch-tui) and [`netwatch-tui-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netwatch-tui-bin) on the AUR, tomasrivera the [nixpkgs package](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-unstable/pkgs/by-name/ne/netwatch/package.nix), [scillidan](https://github.com/scillidan) the [Scoop entry](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/master/bucket/netwatch.json), and the Homebrew maintainers took the formula into core. File packaging problems with them and netwatch bugs here.

[@lamchau](https://github.com/lamchau), [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) and [@PeteE](https://github.com/PeteE) sent patches. Everyone who opened an issue with a repro or argued with a design decision is the reason the output is right on more terminals than mine.
